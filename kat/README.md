Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.



It's up to you to decide when it's appropriate to use which header. In general, headers one and six should be used sparingly.

You can't really make a header bold, but you can italicize certain words. In the box below, make the first line a heading level four, and italicize the name of the book:

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list.
8. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  8. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.  

   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses -->

Task Lists

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
